# Cifar10-Image-recognition
After reading the Ng's article &lt;single layer networks in unsupervised feature learning>, I try to practice this project.

All the codes are writen in Jupyter Notebook, so you guys could see the result clearly.

The naif K-means is just using the K-means to cluster the image, and see the result. Just for fun.

The version 1 there is something i wrongly unstood, but i will still poster. 

The version 2, I use two methode to create a dictionary. 

The first is the soft dictionary

The second is the hard dictionary.

I use the SVM as Ng suggest.
